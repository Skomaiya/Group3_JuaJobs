Phase 5: Market-Specific Design Considerations

Delivered by: Yvette Kwizera

JuaJobs serves a diverse African market with multiple languages, currencies, date formats, and cultural norms. The API is designed to respect these regional differences to ensure accessibility and usability.

1. Localisation Strategy
The JuaJobs API will offer comprehensive localisation to cater to the linguistic and cultural diversity of its target regions.

1.1. Multi-language Support
API Request Parameter: Clients can specify their preferred language using the optional lang query parameter in API requests.

Example: 
    GET /v1/jobs?lang=en (for English),
    GET /v1/jobs?lang=fr (for French), 
    GET /v1/jobs?lang=sw (for Swahili).

Initial Supported Languages: The API will initially support:

    English (en)
    French (fr)
    Swahili (sw)
    Arabic (ar) 

This selection covers key linguistic groups across East, West, and North Africa.

Translated Resource Fields: The following resource fields will be localised:

    job_descriptions
    product_descriptions 
    review_comments
    All system messages (e.g., success messages, warnings).
    Error messages and validation responses will also be localised to enhance user clarity and the debugging experience.

Fallback Mechanism: If the lang query parameter is missing, the API will use the Accept-Language HTTPS header as a fallback for language preference, adhering to standard web practices.


1.2. Currency, Date & Unit Formatting

Currency:
    Currency values will be represented as decimal values, following ISO 4217 codes for currency identification.
    Example: 1500.00 KES (Kenyan Shilling), 2500.00 NGN (Nigerian Naira).

Dates & Timestamps:
    All dates and timestamps will be formatted according to ISO 8601, including timezone information.
    Example: 2025-05-25T10:00:00+03:00 (representing 10:00 AM on May 25, 2025, in a timezone +3 hours from UTC). This will ensure consistency and simplify parsing across different client applications and time zones.

Units:
    The metric system will be the default for units of measurement (e.g., kilometres for distance, kilograms for weight).
    The API design will allow for extensibility to support local measurement preferences if specific regions or industries require them.


1.3. Region-Specific Data Requirements

Location-Based Filtering:
    In addition to standard coordinate-based filtering (latitude, longitude), the API will support filtering by regional administrative divisions specific to African countries (e.g., districts, counties, regions). This enhances the granularity and relevance of job searches.

Local Identification/License Fields:
    Optional fields will be available for local identification numbers (e.g., national ID, passport numbers) or professional licenses, where regulatory compliance or specific job requirements demand their collection. These fields will be marked as optional and subject to appropriate access controls.


1.4. Cultural Adaptations

Sensitive Content Filtering:
    Content filtering mechanisms will be aligned with local cultural norms and sensitivities to ensure the platform remains appropriate and respectful across different regions. This might involve adapting moderation rules based on the cultural context.

Time Display:
    Time displays in API responses will adapt to the local time zones of the user's location, ensuring that scheduled events or job posting times are presented clearly and without confusion.


2. Connectivity & Performance Optimisation
Recognising varying internet connectivity in Africa, the JuaJobs API will be optimised for performance and resilience.

2.1. Batch Operations

Batch Endpoints:
    The API will support dedicated batch endpoints, allowing clients to send multiple individual requests within a single HTTPS call.
    Use Cases: Examples include applying for multiple jobs simultaneously or sending messages to multiple users.

JSON Batch Format:
    A standardised JSON batch format will be used to encapsulate multiple requests, significantly reducing round-trip times (RTT) over unstable networks and improving overall efficiency.


2.2. Caching Strategies

Cache-Control Headers:
    Appropriate Cache-Control headers will be implemented for frequently accessed but rarely changing resources (e.g., job categories, skill lists, static location data).
    Example: Cache-Control: max-age=60, must-revalidate will instruct clients to cache the resource for 60 seconds and then revalidate with the server.

Conditional GET Requests:
    The API will support conditional GET requests using ETag and If-None-Match headers. This allows clients to check if their cached data is still valid, minimising payload transfer on unchanged resources.


2.3. Payload Optimisation

Sparse Fieldsets (fields parameter):
    Clients will be able to specify only the fields they require in API responses using a query parameter.
    Example: GET /v1/jobs?fields=id,title,company_name
    This dramatically reduces the size of the payload, conserving bandwidth.

Pagination (page, limit parameters):
    All list endpoints will enforce pagination to prevent excessively large responses.
    Clients can tune the number of results per page using the limit parameter and navigate through results using the page parameter.

Compressed Responses (gzip/deflate):
    The API will support and encourage compressed responses (gzip/deflate) to reduce bandwidth usage, where supported by client applications.


2.4. Offline-First Support

Local Sync and Conflict Resolution:
    API designs will facilitate offline-first client applications, allowing them to store data locally, make changes, and then synchronise with the server when connectivity is restored.
    The API will provide mechanisms or guidelines for clients to resolve conflicts that may arise during synchronisation.

Sync Endpoints (since timestamp):
    Dedicated endpoints will be provided to retrieve updated resources since a specific timestamp, enabling efficient incremental synchronisation for clients.
    Example: GET /api/v1/jobs/updated?since=2025-05-20T00:00:00Z

Real-Time Updates (Optional):
    For scenarios where stable connectivity is available and real-time updates are beneficial, optional WebSocket or long-polling endpoints will be considered to push immediate updates to clients (e.g., new job notifications, chat messages).


3. Payment Integration Design
Secure and reliable payment integration is critical for monetisation and service delivery.

3.1. Payment Systems Integration

Unified Payment API:
    A unified payment API will be designed to abstract various regional payment methods.

Supported Payment Methods (Tailored to Regional Preferences):
    Mobile Money: Comprehensive support for prominent mobile money platforms (M-Pesa, Airtel Money, Orange Money, MoMo, etc.), which are dominant in many African markets.
    Bank Transfers: Integration with local bank APIs where available, along with support for traditional bank transfer methods.
    Card Payments: Support for international card networks (Visa, MasterCard) for urban users and those preferring card transactions.

3.2. Transaction State Management

Secure Callback/Webhook Endpoints:
    Secure callback/webhook endpoints will be provided for payment gateways to asynchronously update transaction statuses. These endpoints will require robust authentication and validation.

Idempotent Payment Requests:
    Payment initiation requests will be idempotent. This means that sending the same request multiple times (e.g., due to network retries) will only result in a single charge, preventing duplicate billing. A unique idempotency key will be used for this purpose.

3.3. Security Considerations

Data Encryption:
    All sensitive payment data will be encrypted both at rest (in databases) and in transit (using HTTPS/TLS) to protect user financial information.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
    Strict RBAC will be enforced on all payment endpoints. Only authorised roles (e.g., admin) will have access to sensitive payment operations and data.

Audit Trails:
    Comprehensive audit trails will be maintained for all financial operations, logging who performed what action, when, and with what outcome. This is crucial for accountability and troubleshooting.

Compliance:
    The payment integration will adhere strictly to regional payment regulations and data protection laws (e.g., PCI DSS if card data is handled directly, local data privacy acts). Legal consultation will be sought to ensure full compliance.
